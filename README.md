# SongCrush App

This is a playlist creation app that uses Spotify's API. Based on Codecademy's React capstone project, "Jammming," I have rebranded the app, restructured the stylesheets to make it mobile-first, and added more features and style modifications to improve its overall UX. I will continue to streamline the app by implementing more features.
